# ICT Notes

This repository contains notes I created for GCE A/L ICT exam. These notes
aren't complete as this is the knowledge I gather from random places like from
past papers etc. but these notes are helpful. 

Because I have this repository online, public, I can access my notes anytime on
any device, and that's the reason I created this repository in the first place.
However, if you are the rare human being, who found this repository among
thousands of other code repositories in github, feel free to use this
repository, but keep in mind that these notes are only made for my consumption,
so if it didn't suit your needs, I've nothing to do.  :-)

Also, if you're a random guy reading this repository, note that you cannot
measure my CS knowledge by reading content here. Often times, the knowledge we
need to pass exams is useless in real life and vice versa. That's why I've to
study ICT for this exam even I have a sound CS knowledge.
