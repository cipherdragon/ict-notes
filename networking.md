# Networking

## Acronyms

+ ISDN: Integrated Service Digital Network
+ ADSL: Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
+ PSTN: Public Switched Telephone Network
+ DSL : Digital Subscriber Line
+ CDMA: Code Division Multiple Access
+ GSM : Global System for Mobiles
+ DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

<br />

+ \*DMA: \* Division Multiple Access

## Comparing between ADSL and ISDN

+ ISDN : Provides end-to-end (circuit switched) connectivity through a 64kbps digital circuit
+ ADSL : Provides faster data transmission over copper telephone lines. Faster download speed than upload speed

## Comparing between CDMA and GSM

+ CDMA: Allow several transmitters to send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.
Each transmitter is assigned to a code to allow multiple users to be multiplexed over the same physical channel.

+ GSM :An open digital cellular technology used for transmitting mobile voice and data services. Mobile phones 
make the connections by searching for the cells in the immediate vicinity.

## Functions of server technologies

+ Web server - **servers web pages** stored in server to the client computer.
+ Mail server - **provide email facilities** to client computers.
+ Proxy server - **Allow a local network to access the internet through a single public IP address** 
(sharing a single internet connection)
+ DHCP server - **assigns IP addresses dynamically** to computers connected to the network.

## Important points about threats like phishing when answering questions

+ Compromized accounts can be used to spoof attacker's identity, hence do further attacks.

## Round trip delay

Round-trip delay (RTD) or round-trip time (RTT) is the amount of time it takes
for a signal to be sent plus the amount of time it takes for acknowledgement of
that signal having been received.

A RANDOM PERSON READING THIS AND YOU KNOW ABOUT THE TOPIC, PLEASE HELP ME. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
RTD AND LIGHT SPEED?**

## DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

Physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's
external-facing services to an untrusted, usually larger, network such as the
Internet. 

## Reasons a website not working on a computer in a LAN

+ DNS not working
+ Proxy server down
+ Change the proxy settings
+ Internet link isn't working
+ Switch is broken/ not working
+ Cable damage
+ Network card of the computer not working
+ TCP/IP configuration is wrong
+ Computer not properly connected to the network
+ Remote website is down
